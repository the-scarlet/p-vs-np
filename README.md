all my attempts to solve the mystery

these are some authentic & well-elaborated pieces of code that are nowhere else to find. 

most of these algorithms represent a new approach that has never been discussed anywhere else.

feel free to use my work in your projects (ethical ones, pls!)

the journey is not over yet. I will be uploading more code to this repository whenever I can.
